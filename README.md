# hello-world-python-psycopg2

This repo has a "Hello World" Python application that uses the [`psycopg2`](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/install.html) driver to talk to either a temporary local CockroachDB cluster or a free cluster on CockroachCloud.

For instructions on starting CockroachDB and running the code, see [this tutorial](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/build-a-python-app-with-cockroachdb.html).
